Hello everyone! My name is Zelong, or you can call me Alan. Iâ€™m from China and currently a senior double majoring in Data Science and Math-Econ. I took DSC 80 during my second year, and it truly piqued my interest in this fascinating field. The ideas and intuitions behind the concepts youâ€™ll learn in this course serve as crucial building blocks for more complex models in the future.

In my free time, I enjoy going to 24 Hour Gym, playing video games, and playing tennisðŸŽ¾. If youâ€™re curious to learn more about me, feel free to check out my personal website. Iâ€™m always happy to chat, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! Looking forward to working with you all. ðŸ˜Š
