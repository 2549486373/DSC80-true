Hi everyone! I’m Giorgia, a second year graduate student in HDSI. I’m originally from San Diego and loved it so much I had to come back for grad school! Outside of academics I spend most of my time making memories with friends, trying new restaurants, and have hopped on the pickleball trend. I look forward to meeting and working with everyone in DSC 80!
