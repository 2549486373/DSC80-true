Hi everyone, my name is Lauren and I am from Walnut, California. I am currently a third year undergraduate student double major in Data Science and joint Math Econ. I am really excited to tutor DSC 80 this quarter because it was one of my favorite course and I really enjoyed those projects. They are definitely good content for your resume. This past summer I picked up rock climbing as my new hobby and I highly recommend everyone to try it🧗🏻‍♀️. I look forward to meeting you all during office hours😄.
