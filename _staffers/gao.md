Hi everyone! My name is Doris, I am a 4th-year data science and math-econ double major student. I am originally from Guangzhou, China, and moved to San Francisco 8 years ago. Outside of classes, I like getting boba, playing cello, and skiing. I think dsc80 has been one of the most useful courses from the DSC lower division, so I am really excited to meet and work with you guys!
